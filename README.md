# Racing Car
Racing Car Game is an old game in which the user tries to win a car race. The user
competes against other cars controlled by the computer to reach the finish line first.
We have also built a similar game which is based on this idea. In the game, the user
competes against 3 other cars controlled by the computer, in order to win the game,
the user must reach the finish line first and if the user fails to do so, then the user
loses the game. We used graphics header file for making the game more attractive,
interactive and competitive. We used the conditional statements and loop for
desirable flow of the program
For this project, we used the graphics.h header file with the help of which we were
able to create a base for the game and make the game interactive and attractive.
The race lines, traffic signals, boards, bushes and cars all were given by the
graphics.h header file. This header file also has a feature of entering colour in
different shapes in the output window. For movement of different shapes and
models in the game we used the while and for loop so that the shapes and models
can move in one swift direction. But these loops come with a problem of flickering
of the shapes as they move in on the screen because we are using for loop and due
to that, the shape and models are drawn each time we use a for loop and the
previous drawings are cleared so as to avoid any overlap of the previous drawing
on the new one. We used the cleardevice() function for this work, which clears
everything on the output window when it is called.
